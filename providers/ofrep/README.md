# OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol Provider

This is the Go implementation of the OFREP provider.
The provider works by evaluating flags against OFREP single flag evaluation endpoint.

## Installation

Use OFREP provider with the latest OpenFeature Go SDK

```sh
go get github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib/providers/ofrep
go get github.com/open-feature/go-sdk
```

## Usage

Initialize the provider with the URL of the OFREP implementing service,

```go
ofrepProvider := ofrep.NewProvider("http://localhost:8016")
```

Then, register the provider with the OpenFeature Go SDK and use derived clients for flag evaluations,

```go
openfeature.SetProvider(ofrepProvider)
```

## Configuration

You can configure the provider using following configuration options,
